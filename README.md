# Smart-City-Traffic-Management
Smart City Traffic Management



A JavaFX-based desktop application for intelligent traffic prediction and analysis using Apache Spark and Machine Learning. This project is built as part of a smart city initiative to analyze and predict traffic trends in Pune city using real-world data.

📌 Features
🔮 Traffic Prediction using ML models

Linear Regression to predict future vehicle count at various junctions

Logistic Regression to classify road conditions based on patterns

📊 Dashboard & Visual Analytics

Interactive visualizations for traffic insights (bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, etc.)

🗃️ Dataset Insights

Real dataset from Pune city containing:

Junction Names

Vehicle Counts

Road Conditions

Dates and Time

⚡ Built on Apache Spark for distributed data processing

💻 Clean and responsive JavaFX GUI

🛠️ Tech Stack
Component	Technology
Frontend	JavaFX (JDK 21, JavaFX 23.0.2)
Backend	Apache Spark
ML Models	Linear & Logistic Regression
Language	Java
Visualization	JavaFX Charts
🧠 Machine Learning Approach
Linear Regression: Trained on historical vehicle count data to predict future traffic load at specific junctions.

Logistic Regression: Classifies road conditions (e.g., smooth, congested, damaged) based on multiple features.

📈 Sample Dashboard
The application includes a Dashboard that allows users to:

View daily/weekly/monthly traffic variations

Analyze road condition trends over time

Compare junction-wise traffic using graphs

Visuals include:

Bar Graphs

Line Charts

Pie Charts

Heatmaps (optional depending on your implementation)

📂 Dataset
Source: Pune City Traffic Department (or mention your source)

Fields:

Junction Name

Vehicle Count

Road Condition

Date

Time Slot (if applicable)

🚀 How to Run
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-city-traffic-management.git
Open the project in your Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse).

Make sure Apache Spark is installed and configured.

Run the Main.java file to launch the JavaFX GUI.

📌 Future Scope
Add real-time traffic updates using IoT sensors or APIs

Integrate Google Maps or city GIS data
